Can we create a better social media platform by open-sourcing all the code and removing the profit motive?
## Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
The intentional misinformation campaigns spread by Putin's bots on Twitter.  The unintentional spread of fake news by everyday people on Facebook.  The obsessional vanity of men and women, boys and girls, being fueled by Instagram likes.  The countless interesting article *headlines* read on Reddit, without ever reading *the articles themselves*, and therefore substatantively enriching oneself.

Now, I don't want to sound like some "boomer", disparaging the youth and all their new-fangled technologies, but I think we can all agree: something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  There are serious issues that need to be addressed.  Social media addiction is a real thing.  Misinformation and propoganda have taken new forms.  Deep loneliness abides, in spite of all your virtual "friends".

## Could we make it better?

### Observation: Wikipedia is more full of facts/objectivity than Facebook's News Feed
